# CHIMERA - Post-Quantum Polymorphic Steganography

**Quantum-Safe, Adaptive Covert-Channel Framework**

A polymorphic framework designed to create practically undetectable, hidden communication channels by disguising data as benign network traffic with post-quantum cryptographic security.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status

**This project represents an ongoing learning and coding journey into steganographic communication systems. It is experimental, educational software. No guarantees are provided.**

I'm not working on it 24/7, so if you have any observations, feedback, or want to contribute, please email me at `halaszoliver45(at)gmail.com`.

## Project Goals

CHIMERA aims to be a comprehensive steganographic communication system that:
- **Embeds data in DNS traffic** (DoH/DoT channels) to appear as standard encrypted HTTPS traffic.
- **Implements post-quantum cryptography** with a TLS 1.3 hybrid key exchange (X25519+ML-KEM768).
- **Dynamically switches between transport layers** (DoH, DoT, UDP/53) using behavioral timing profiles to evade detection.
- Aims for a **3 Mbps throughput** with a false positive rate of less than 1% on intrusion detection systems.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What Currently Works (Phase 1 Complete!)

- **Robust Base64 encoding/decoding**: Complete implementation with proper padding handling.
- **DNS Packet Building**: Structured packet construction with random IDs and proper headers.
- **UDP Socket Communication**: Basic DNS query sending over UDP with timeout support.
- **Client Configuration System**: Flexible configuration setup with validation.
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line argument parsing and file input support for the demo application.
- **Build System**: Cross-platform CMake configuration with CI/CD pipeline defined in `ci.yml`.
- **Random Subdomain Generation**: Dynamic domain generation for steganographic queries.
- **AEAD Cryptography Layer**: Complete crypto module using **libsodium** providing **ChaCha20-Poly1305** for authenticated encryption.
- **Hybrid Key Exchange Framework**: **NEW!** Complete API and structure for TLS 1.3 hybrid key exchange (X25519 + ML-KEM768) with real X25519 implementation.
- **Key Derivation**: HKDF-based key derivation from combined classical and post-quantum secrets.
- **Professional Codebase**: Updated with English-only user interface and professional Hungarian comments.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test suite covering all core functionalities including hybrid cryptography.

### üöß What's In Progress

- **ML-KEM768 Integration**: The hybrid key exchange structure is complete, but currently uses a placeholder ML-KEM768 implementation. Integration with **liboqs**, **PQClean**, or **Kyber reference implementation** is the next priority.

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work Yet

- **DNS Response Parsing**: The system only sends queries; it does not yet handle or parse responses.
- **TLS/DoH/DoT Support**: Only basic UDP/53 DNS is implemented. Secure transports are next on the roadmap.
- **Production-Ready Post-Quantum Cryptography**: ML-KEM768 placeholder needs replacement with real implementation.
- **Behavioral Mimicry**: No advanced timing profiles or traffic analysis evasion techniques are implemented.
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Communication is currently synchronous. Integration of `io_uring` or `Boost.Asio` is planned for high-performance I/O.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system.

1.  **C++23 Compiler**: GCC (version 12+) or Clang (version 15+).
2.  **CMake**: Version 3.16 or higher is required.
3.  **Libsodium**: The core cryptography library.

-   **From Source:**
    If your package manager doesn't have it, you can compile it from source by following the official [libsodium installation instructions](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/installation).

### Building the Project

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chimera.git
cd chimera

# 2. Create a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# 3. Configure with CMake
# For a standard release build:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# For a debug build:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# 4. Compile the code
# Using make (adjust -j for your number of CPU cores)
make -j$(nproc)

# Using Ninja for potentially faster builds
# cmake -G Ninja ..
# ninja
```

## Running

After a successful build, the executables will be in the `build/` directory.

```bash
# Run the demo application with a default message
./build/chimera_demo

# Run the demo with a message from a file
./build/chimera_demo message.txt

# Run with a custom DNS server and domain
./build/chimera_demo -s 1.1.1.1 -d my-covert-domain.com message.txt

# Run the comprehensive test suite (including new crypto tests)
./build/chimera_test
# or use the custom make target
make run_tests
```

### Command Line Options

- `-s, --server`: DNS server address (default: 8.8.8.8)
- `-p, --port`: DNS server port (default: 53)
- `-d, --domain`: Target domain (default: example.com)
- `-t, --timeout`: Timeout in milliseconds (default: 5000)

## Architecture Overview

The project is structured for modularity and testability:

- **Core Library (`chimera_core`)**: Contains all core logic including:
    - **Client Module**: High-level steganographic communication interface
    - **DNS Packet Module**: Low-level DNS protocol handling
    - **Crypto Module**: **NEW!** Hybrid cryptographic primitives (AEAD + Key Exchange)
- **Demo Application (`chimera_demo`)**: Command-line executable to showcase and test the library's functionality
- **Test Suite (`chimera_test`)**: Comprehensive testing including crypto validation and benchmarks

### Cryptographic Architecture

CHIMERA implements a **defense-in-depth** cryptographic approach:

1. **Hybrid Key Exchange** (X25519 + ML-KEM768):
    - Classical X25519 ECDH for current security
    - ML-KEM768 for post-quantum resistance
    - Combined secrets via HKDF for maximum security

2. **AEAD Encryption** (ChaCha20-Poly1305):
    - Authenticated encryption with associated data
    - Protects against tampering and replay attacks
    - Proven security with high performance

**Note**: Source code comments are primarily in Hungarian, as it's my native language and helps me think through complex problems more efficiently during this learning phase.

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: C++23
- **Build**: CMake (3.16+)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Cryptography**:
    - **libsodium 1.0.19+**: For AEAD encryption layer (ChaCha20-Poly1305) and X25519 key exchange
    - **ML-KEM768**: Placeholder implementation (production requires liboqs/PQClean integration)
    - **HKDF**: Key derivation from hybrid secrets
- **Error Handling**: `tl::expected` for functional error management
- **I/O**: Native sockets, with `io_uring` (Linux) and `Boost.Asio` (cross-platform) planned for future async implementation
- **Testing**: Custom test runner with plans to migrate to Catch2 or Google Test

    -   [ ] Advanced DNS codec supporting A, AAAA, and TXT records
    -   [ ] HTTP/2 body-based encoding for DoH transport
    -   [ ] DNS response parsing and bidirectional communication

4.  **Phase 4: Behavioral Mimicry**
    -   [ ] Implement behavioral profiles (e.g., "web browsing," "cloud sync")
    -   [ ] Load timing patterns from external configuration files (e.g., YAML)
    -   [ ] Traffic analysis evasion techniques

5.  **Phase 5: Integration & CLI**
    -   [ ] Enhance the `chimera-cli` with send/receive and diagnostic tools
    -   [ ] Create a Docker Compose environment for testing and simulation
    -   [ ] Configuration file support (JSON/YAML)

6.  **Phase 6 & 7: Formal Verification & Security Audit**
    -   [ ] Use TLA+ for formal model checking of the handshake protocol
    -   [ ] Integrate static analysis and fuzz testing (`clang-tidy`, `libFuzzer`)
    -   [ ] Third-party security audit of cryptographic implementation

## Security Considerations

- **Hybrid Cryptography**: Protects against both classical and quantum attacks
- **Forward Secrecy**: Each session uses ephemeral keys
- **Authentication**: AEAD prevents message tampering and forgery
- **Randomization**: Cryptographically secure random number generation
- **Side-Channel Resistance**: Built on libsodium's proven implementations

**Important**: The current ML-KEM768 implementation is a placeholder for structural demonstration. **Do not use in production** until replaced with a verified implementation.
