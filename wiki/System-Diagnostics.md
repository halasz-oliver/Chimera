# System Diagnostics in Chimera

## Overview

Chimera's System Diagnostics framework provides a comprehensive toolset for assessing system compatibility, performance, and potential configuration issues. This feature helps users understand their environment and ensure optimal functionality of the steganographic communication system.

## Key Features

### 1. Preflight Checks
The `SystemDiagnostics` class performs multiple critical checks to validate system readiness:

- **Cryptographic Library Verification**
  - Checks for presence of essential cryptographic libraries (libsodium, liboqs)
  - Ensures cryptographic capabilities are fully supported

- **Network Capabilities Assessment**
  - Performs basic DNS resolution test
  - Validates network configuration and connectivity

- **Performance Metrics Monitoring**
  - Checks memory consumption
  - Identifies potential resource constraints

- **File Permission Validation**
  - Verifies executable permissions
  - Ensures proper system access

## Usage Examples

### Running Preflight Checks
```cpp
#include "chimera/system_diagnostics.hpp"

// Run comprehensive system checks
auto diagnostics = chimera::SystemDiagnostics::runPreflightChecks();
```

### Generating Detailed Report
```cpp
// Generate a comprehensive diagnostic report
std::string report = chimera::SystemDiagnostics::generateDetailedReport();
std::cout << report;
```

### Logging Specific Diagnostics
```cpp
// Log a specific diagnostic message
chimera::SystemDiagnostics::logDiagnostic(
    chimera::DiagnosticLevel::WARNING, 
    "Potential network configuration issue"
);
```

## Diagnostic Levels

Chimera uses a multi-level diagnostic reporting system:

| Level     | Description                                     | Action Recommended |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| INFO      | Standard operational information               | None               |
| WARNING   | Potential performance or configuration issues  | Review settings    |
| ERROR     | Significant functional limitations             | Immediate attention|
| CRITICAL  | Severe system incompatibility                  | System reconfiguration |

## Best Practices

1. Run preflight checks before initializing Chimera client
2. Generate diagnostic reports during initial setup
3. Monitor system diagnostics periodically
4. Address warnings and errors promptly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter diagnostic warnings or errors:
- Review the specific message and suggestion
- Verify system dependencies
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Guide](Troubleshooting.md)
- Contact support if issues persist

## Advanced Configuration

The diagnostic framework is extensible. Developers can:
- Add custom diagnostic checks
- Implement additional verification methods
- Extend the reporting mechanism

## Performance Impact

The diagnostic checks are lightweight and designed to have minimal overhead:
- Typical check duration: < 50ms
- Memory footprint: Negligible
- No performance degradation during normal operation

## Security Considerations

System Diagnostics:
- Do not collect or transmit personal data
- Operate entirely within the local system
- Provide only non-sensitive configuration insights
